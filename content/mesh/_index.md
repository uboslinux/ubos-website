---

The UBOS Personal Data Mesh is a new software component in the overall
UBOS architecture, which is shown here:

<p class="img"><img src="/images/architecture.png"></p>

The UBOS Personal Data Mesh is middleware that:

* manages personal data in a fine-grained (not file-based) manner;
* has a range of importers to import data from Facebook, Google, Amazon
  and other major collectors of personal data;
* is based on MeshBase, an in-memory, strongly typed,
  graph-centric, multi-paradigm database with explicit semantic models;
* enables the development of "L-Apps" that make use of that integrated
  personal data.

The UBOS Personal Data Mesh is still in active development.

What could you build if you had access to all the same data that Facebook
has about a user? And Google. And Amazon. And and and. All in one place,
with nice, consistent APIs regardless where the data came from.

Now you can. Intrigued? Please join us.
