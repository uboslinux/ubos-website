title: UBOS Mesh
---

The UBOS Mesh is a new software component in the overall
UBOS architecture that is still in development. It is middleware that:

* manages personal data in a fine-grained (not file-based) manner;
* has a range of importers to import data from Facebook, Google, Amazon
  and other major collectors of personal data;
* is based on MeshBase, an in-memory, strongly typed,
  graph-centric, multi-paradigm database with explicit semantic models;
