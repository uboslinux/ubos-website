## To upgrade

To be safe, first create a backup of all your sites, with a command such as:

* ``sudo ubos-admin backup --all --backuptodirectory ~``

Then, update your device:

* ``sudo ubos-admin update -v``

## Major package upgrades in this version

* Nextcloud is now at version 20.0.0. It includes the recently release Nextcloud
  Dashboard, and many productivity and integration enhancements.

* Mastodon is now at 3.2.0 (``yellow`` channel only).
