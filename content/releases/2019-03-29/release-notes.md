## To upgrade

To be safe, first create a backup of all your sites to a suitable file:

* ``sudo ubos-admin backup --backuptodirectory ~``

Then, update your device:

* ``sudo ubos-admin update -v``

{{% warning %}}
Before upgrading on Amazon EC2, you need to update your instance's
kernel command line, otherwise the instance will fail to connect to the network
upon reboot. Details see below.

## What's new

### Package upgrades:

* Nextcloud
* Mastodon
* Wordpress
* Linux is now at kernel version 5.0.x (x86_64 only for now)
* Mariadb is now at 10.3.x
* Bitcoin daemon
* Ethereum daemon

There were several hundred package upgrades in total.

### Notable new packages:

* Matomo, an analytics application (formerly named Piwik)
* The GNU debugger: gdb
* The PHP debugger: xdebug
* The Node version manager: nvm
* IPFS: go-ipfs
* More Wordpress plugins, such as Pterotype and SEO

### Fixes and improvements:

* Various backup/restore issues were fixed. These had impacted primarily sites running
  Shaarli and Selfoss.
* Nextcloud installations now set the admin e-mail address automatically
* Nextcloud now shows memory info
* DNSSEC is turned off by default, as it appears to be incompatible with many deployed
  DNS servers that don't support it.

### Changes for developers:

* Apps based on Node now need to package their own node runtime. More info is in
  the {{% pageref "/docs/developers/middleware-notes/nodejs.md" documentation %}}.

## Removed functionality

* Mastodon has been (temporarily) removed from the ARM architectures.

## Other

* To find which issues have been closed as part of this release, search the
  [Github repos](https://github.com/uboslinux/) for milestones
  ``ubos-18`` and ``ubos-apps-18``.

* The Personal Public License has had some clarifying edits. See
  {{% pageref "/blog/2019/03/29/license-update.md" post %}}.

## Known issues

* ``ubos-admin status`` emits some (harmless) errors under some circumstances.

* Running Pagekite with ``ubos-admin start-pagekite`` on a device that runs a wildcard
  site (ie a site whose hostname was specified as ``*``) may not forward the traffic
  correctly. Redeploy the site with its public hostname instead.

* On Amazon EC2, the kernel command-line needs to be updated **prior** to an upgrade.
  Here are the steps:

  1. As root, edit file ``/etc/default/grub``. Look for the line (towards the beginning
     of the file) that starts with ``GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT``. Change the line
     to read:

     ```
     GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="nomodeset console=ttyS0,9600n8 earlyprintk=serial,ttyS0,9600,verbose loglevel=7 init=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd"
     ```

     Save the file.

  1. As root, execute: ``grub-install --recheck /dev/xvda``

  1. As root, execute: ``grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg``

  1. Now perform the update with: ``sudo ubos-admin update``
