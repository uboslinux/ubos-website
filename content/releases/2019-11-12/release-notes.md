## To upgrade

To be safe, first create a backup of all your sites to a suitable file, with a
command such as:

* ``sudo ubos-admin backup --backuptodirectory ~``

Then, update your device:

* ``sudo ubos-admin update -v``

### New features

Those apps that may send e-mail now automatically activate a local, outgoing e-mail server
(``postfix``). However, you may need to work around your internet service provider to
actually get mail out from your home network: see {{% pageref "/docs/administrators/apps/amazonses.md" %}}.

### Bug fixes

The usual: fixed bugs and made improvements. You can find the closed issues
[on Github](https://github.com/uboslinux/) tagged with milestone ``ubos-apps-20``.

## Known problems

In one instance, a Matomo upgrade failed with ``Error in Matomo: Mysqli prepare error:
Access denied for user ... to database ...``. This problem goes away if the Goals plugin
is disabled (go to Administration / System / Plugins).

## Note on skipped Nextcloud major version upgrades

If you have not upgraded your UBOS device running Nextcloud for a while, the Nextcloud
upgrader may not be able to upgrade your installation in one go. As a workaround, we have
introduced packages ``nextcloud16`` and ``nextcloud15``, which contain Nextcloud version
16 and 15, respectively. You can use these packages as an intermediate step to upgrade
from an earlier Nextcloud to the current version. This is described in more detail in
:doc:`/users/apps/nextcloud`.
