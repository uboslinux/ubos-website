## To upgrade

To be safe, first create a backup of all your sites, with a command such as:

* ``sudo ubos-admin backup --all --backuptodirectory ~``

Then, update your device:

* ``sudo ubos-admin update -v``

Note: You may receive a message that says "Failed to refresh some expired keys".
This is harmless and you can ignore it.

## New packages in this version

* The Collabora Online "app" is now available for Nextcloud. When creating the Site,
  you need to add ``nextcloud-richdocuments`` and ``nextcloud-richdocumentscode``
  as Accessories.

* The Nextcloud forms app is now available. Add ``nextcloud-forms`` to your list
  of Accessories.

## Major package upgrades in this version

* Matomo now at 3.14.0

* MediaWiki now at 1.34.2

* Nextcloud and many Nextcloud accessories. Nextcloud is now at version 19.0.1.
