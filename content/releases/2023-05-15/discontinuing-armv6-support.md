title: Discontinuing ARMv6 support
date: 2023-05-15
---

Starting with today's release, we are discontinuing support for ARMv6 devices,
such as the original Raspberry Pi and Pi Zero.

They were sweet devices for their time, but times have moved on, and few people are
stilling using them. Most of the app on UBOS need more computing power anyway than
those devices provided.

Instead, that lets us focus on newer hardware platforms and innovative code.
Onwards!
