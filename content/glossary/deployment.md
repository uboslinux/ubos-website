The action that makes one or more {{% gls App %}} (plus potentially one or
more {{% gls Accessory %}}) run at a {{% gl Site %}}. The association between
an {{% gl App %}} (plus potentially one or more {{% gls Accessory %}}) and the
{{% gl Site %}} is by way of an {{% gl AppConfiguration %}}.

{{% gl Deployment %}} requires that the code for all needed {{% gls App %}}
and {{% gls Accessory %}} was {{% gl Installation installed %}}
on the {{% gl Device %}} first.
