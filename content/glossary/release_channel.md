A maturity level for a UBOS release.

UBOS is developed on channel ``red``, which contains bleeding-edge, untested
"alpha" quality code. Channel ``yellow`` corresponds to traditional "beta" code,
while ``green`` is the production channel.

End users almost always will subscribe to ``green``, while developers will
do most of their work on ``red`` and ``yellow``.

This is described in more detail in the
{{% pageref "/docs/developers/buildrelease" "developer documentation" %}}.
