A computer that is primarily accessed over the network, and fully owned by the
person who purchased it.

For example, a Raspberry Pi running an open-source web application that allows
users to control the lights in their house from a web browser would be
a {{% gl Home_Server %}}. As a counter-example, if users could control the lights in
their house from a web browser connecting to some vendor's website, this may
involve a "server" in their house, but not one they control.
