The part of the [Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things)
that is independently owned and operated. Contrast with "Overlord IoT".

For example, the [NEST thermostat](http://nest.com/) is not part of the
Indie IoT (Google hermetically seals the device, and siphons the data before
the "owner" of the device sees it), while a similar product that kept data
local and allowed the owner to modify it at will would be part of the Indie IoT.
