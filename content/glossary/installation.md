The action that makes the code for an {{% gl App %}}, {{% gl Accessory %}}
or other {{% gl Package %}} available on a {{% gl Device %}}.

Unlike {{% gl Deployment %}}, {{% gl Installation %}} merely makes code
available on a {{% gl Device %}} and does not configure it, nor configure related
services (like web servers or databases).
