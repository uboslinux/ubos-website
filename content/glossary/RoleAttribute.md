A free-form named slot for a value on a connection between two MeshObjects.
This is similar to how in some programming languages, you can
create arbitrary new fields on objects at run-time. Except that this
field sits on (one side of) an edge between two {{% gls MeshObject %}}, not on
a {{% gl MeshObject %}} itself.
