title: diet4j module framework
summary: A module framework for Java
domain: UBOS Mesh
---

It allows us to distribute {{% gl mesh %}} as a set of JARs, and dynamically
configure the running application based on what code has been installed
on the local device, and a run-time configuration.

It also allows code such as {{% gl codegen %}} to dynamically query
what code modules are available on the local device.
