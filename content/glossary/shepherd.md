The UBOS {{% gl Shepherd %}} is the person who administers one or more {{% gls Device %}}
running UBOS. These {{% gls Device %}} together are called the {{% gl Shepherd %}}'s
{{% gl Flock %}}.

The {{% gl Shepherd %}} uses a USB stick, called the {{% gl UBOS_Staff %}}, to
configure each {{% gl Device %}} in the {{% gl Flock %}} by booting it with the
{{% gl UBOS_Staff %}} present in the {{% gl Device %}}'s USB port.

Configuration information picked up by the UBOS {{% gl Device %}} will remain valid
until the {{% gl Shepherd %}} reboots the {{% gl Device %}} with a different, or
differently configured {{% gl UBOS_Staff %}} inserted.

After the initial boot, the {{% gl Shepherd %}} can use a Linux account called ``shepherd``
to administer {{% gls Device %}}.
