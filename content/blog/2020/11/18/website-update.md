We are happy to release the updated UBOS website. Among other things:

* There is now a {{% pageref "/glossary/" %}}. If you were ever
  wondering what UBOS means when it says {{% gl Site %}} or
  {{% gl AppConfigItem %}}, you know where to go! Much of the
  documentation has been updated to link to the glossary.

* The user FAQ, howto and troubleshooting pages have been restructured and
  merged into a single place {{% pageref "/docs/administrators/faq-howto-troubleshooting/" here %}},
  so solution to problems are easier to find.

* The {{% pageref "/docs/developers/" %}} has been restructured and
  is now easier to browse.

* There is breadcrumb navigation throughout the documentation.

* Some URLs have moved. Sorry about that.

* Most importantly for us, although maybe not for you, the reader,
  the entire ubos.net site is now generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/),
  instead of the previous combination of Hugo and Sphinx (and before
  that, Jekyll and Sphinx). Porting was a lot of work, but going
  forward, maintenance should be much simpler.

* The [Github ubos-docs repo](https://github.com/uboslinux/ubos-docs/)
  will be retired, because everything is now in the
  [ubos-website repo](https://github.com/uboslinux/ubos-website/).
