The UBOS project has always been extremely ambitious. So far, we have had:

* **UBOS Linux**, the Linux distro that makes self-hosting easy;

* **UBOSbox**, a ready-to-use home server appliance distributed by
  [Indie Computing](https://indiecomputing.com/products/) as well
  as related cloud offerings;

but that's only where it is starting to get interesting!

We are proud to stop whispering and introduce the latest member of the UBOS family:

* **UBOS Personal Data Mesh**, a middleware software component that knows
  how to import data exported from major internet platforms (like Facebook)
  and make it available to app developers.
