# Ideas

Here is a collection of ideas.

## More importers, of course

* The rest of Google:

  * Gmail. Parse senders and receivers, augment address book. Keep threads.

  * Youtube.

  * Location

* The rest of Facebook, including:

  * Location. Needs to be merged with Google's.

* Amazon, in particular:

  * ~~Purchases~~ DONE

* LinkedIn, further augmenting the address book.

* Netflix watching history.

* macOS address book

* Web browsing history. Needs a browser plugin? Maybe a bookmarklet?

* Banking and credit card info

* Various data brokers

## Viewlets

* Easy correction of misidentified people / profile matches.

* Augment Person Viewlet so other properties can be edited easily,
  like addresses, e-mail etc

* Address book record "aging" ... people who we haven't had contact
  with in a long time "fade out" of the work set.

* various graphs with self-analytics, e.g. photo post frequency,
  Facebook post frequency, most common e-mail addressees etc

## "Rooms"

A "room" is a workbench created for, and optimized for the needs of a
particular use case.

### A "project room"

Different variations depending on the type of project. Has:

* to-do items
* "in-box" with bookmarked URLs. When bookmarking anything, a special
  flag tags the bookmark to be relevant for this project, and then it
  shows up in its in-box until "worked down".
* list of stakeholders (relationships to instances of Person) with a
  project-specific set of notes.

### "Research room"

Special case of a "project room". Can be applied to different types of
research, e.g. competitor research ("market for X") or product research
("Which CLR should I buy?").

* list of products/companies, each with a description, link that's
  specific to the project
* list of "features", each of which defines a data type (e.g. boolean:
  product does / does not have certain feature like "Japanese user manual",
  or weight)
* fill in "matrix" between company/product and feature
* relationship to bookmarks, identifying the source of the information
  for the value in the matrix.

etc. etc.
