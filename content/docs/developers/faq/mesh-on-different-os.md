title: Is it possible to run UBOS Mesh on an operating system other than UBOS Linux?

Yes. There is nothing in {{% gl mesh %}} that depends on facilities that
only exist on {{% gl linux %}}.

We currently do not provide any packages or other support, however,
and building those may not be worth your while: if your host operating
system is something else, why not run {{% gl mesh %}} in {{% gl linux %}}
container? That might be easiest.
