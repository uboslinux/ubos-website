title: How to get help
---

Here are some suggestions:

* Visit the {{% pageref _index.md %}} section on this site.

* Come find us {{% pageref community.md here %}} and ask. We don't bite. At least not
  if we had breakfast.

* Ask a friendly Linux geek you might know.

* Post to the [UBOS Forum](https://forum.ubos.net/).

In any case, please submit as much detail about your problem has you can, including
the output of ``sudo ubos-admin status``.
