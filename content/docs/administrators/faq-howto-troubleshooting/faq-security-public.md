title: Is it safe to have my Site accessible from the public web?
---

This is one of these unanswerable questions. Like: is it safe to go on a two-week vacation
or will my house be broken into while I'm gone? We can't quite answer that question.

But here are some thoughts:

* If you use UBOS on the `yellow` ("beta") release channel, assume there are bugs.

* If you use UBOS on the `green` ("production") release channel, still assume that there
  are bugs.

* To see which bugs have been filed, go to `Github <https://github.com/uboslinux/>`_.

* As an free project, UBOS is "as-is" and we make no warranties of any kind.

* So far, we are not aware of any break-in or compromise of any UBOS system by
  anybody.

* We run UBOS ourselves, and we definitely don't want to be compromised.
