title: "I need a Package that isn't in UBOS"
---

If so, please file a
[bug against the apps-wanted repository](https://github.com/uboslinux/apps-wanted/issues/new),
stating the name of the {{% gl Package %}} and why you think you need it. It would be best if you
could identify the exact package name in the
[Arch Linux repositories](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/)
and/or the link to the project developing it. When that happens, we usually add the
{{% gl Package %}} to the next UBOS release.

In the meantime, you can install many Arch Linux packages directly on UBOS: download
the package for your hardware platform (x86 from the
[Arch Linux project](https://www.archlinux.org/)
and ARM from the [Arch Linux ARM project](https://www.archlinuxarm.org/)), and
use ``pacman -U`` to install.
