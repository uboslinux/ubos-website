title: Why does UBOS ask for a domain name when installing a new Site?
---

UBOS mostly cares about {{% gls App %}} that are accessible over the web. To access an
{{% gls App %}} over the web, your browser needs to know which server to talk to (the web is
a big place!) and the common way of doing that is to use domain (DNS) names.

This is why ``ubos-admin createsite`` asks for a domain name.
