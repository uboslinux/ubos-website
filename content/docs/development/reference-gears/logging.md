title: Logging

Things may go wrong. It's computers, after all. If a log exists, developers and/or
users have a chance of figuring out what happened, and fix whatever the problem was.
Without such logs, life can be very frustrating. So, let's log!

Analyzing what happened on a user's device is easier if all code on that device
uses single logging facility. If a problem occurs due to an unexpected interaction
between two different components, for example, a single log has all events in
chronological sequence and debugging is much easier.

## Log levels

By default, all {{% gls Package %}}, {{% gls App %}} and {{% gls Accessory %}} on UBOS
should log warnings, errors and above. They should not log informational, debug-level or
other low-level messages.

It should be documented how it is possible to temporarily change the level of logging,
e.g. to assist the user with diagnosing and resolving a problem.

## Journald-based logging

UBOS uses the logging facilities provided by ``systemd``'s ``journald``. All {{% gls Package %}},
{{% gls App %}} and {{% gls Accessory %}} are strongly encouraged to use them.

You can find a few excellent introductions to logging via systemd on-line, e.g.

* [Using the Journal](http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/journalctl.html)
* [Logging to the Journal](http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/journal-submit.html).

For general information about systemd, see the
[Systemd home page](http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/).

When logging, developers are encouraged to provide as much contextual information as
needed to understanding the context of the message, in particular the {{% gl AppConfigId %}}
of the deployment that the log message refers to. The syslog identifier should be
set to the name of the reporting package.

## If Journald-based logging is not possible

Sometimes it is not possible to use ``systemd``'s ``journald``. For example, a web
server might log every request, and that would overwhelm the journal.

In this case, an {{% gl Package %}}, {{% gl App %}} or {{% gl Accessory %}} should:

* write log files into directory ``/ubos/log/<dir>``, where ``<dir>`` is the name of the
  package, plus hyphen, plus the applicable {{% gl AppConfigId %}}.

  For example, if the name of the {{% gl App %}} is ``myapp`` and it has been deployed to
  {{% gl AppConfiguration %}} ``a1234567890``, it should write its log files into directory
  ``/ubos/log/myapp-a123456789``.

* set up a ``logrotate`` policy that prevents those log files from growing endlessly.
  This is as simple as writing a file to ``/etc/logrotate.d``.

* cleanly close log files upon a log rotation event.

In case of a package that logs but that is not uniquely associated with a particular
{{% gl AppConfigId %}}, it should:

* write log files into directory ``/ubos/log/<dir>``, where ``<dir>`` is the name of the
  package. For example, if the name of the package is ``mydbserver``, it should write its
  log files into directory ``/ubos/log/mydbserver``.

* it also needs to set up a ``logrotate`` policy and cleanly close log files upon
  rotation.

Here is an example for the Apache web server's ``logrotate`` policy, located in
``/etc/logrotate.d/httpd``:

```
/var/log/httpd/*log {
    missingok
    sharedscripts
    compress
    postrotate
        /usr/bin/systemctl reload httpd.service 2>/dev/null || true
    endscript
}
```

You can see that in this configuration, log files will be compressed to save space,
and after a rotation has been performed, the web server is cleanly restarted.
