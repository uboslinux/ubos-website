title: What text editor can I use on UBOS?
---

By default, we install ``vi``.

Alternatively you can use ``vim`` or ``nano``. (If you are not already
familiar with ``vi`` or ``vim``, we suggest ``nano``, it's much more
intuitive.)

First you need to install the package, e.g.

```
% sudo pacman -S nano
```

and then you can use it to edit a file, e.g.

```
% nano myfile
```
